# Hi!

This is an R Markdown template for creating a single `rstudio4edu` lesson, intended for HTML output.

# Make it your own

To add a logo, do one of two things:

1. Copy your logo image file to the root directory (or a subfolder, if you prefer) and name it `my-logo.png`. 
    + If you want to name it something else, like `my-college-logo.png`, edit the first code chunk above named `logo`. Where you see `knitr::image_uri()`, change `"my-logo.png"` to the file path to your logo image. 
    + If you want to put your logo in a subfolder, append the file path (relative to where this `.Rmd` file lives) to your image name.

1. If you don't have your own logo, you can use our `rstudio4edu` logo by changing `"my-logo.png"` to `"rstudio4edu-logo.png"`. Here is what it looks like:

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("rstudio4edu-logo.png")
    ```

    Pretty, right? We like it. Feel free to use it.  
\

*\*If you don't want a logo at all--then delete the code chunk or set it to* `eval = FALSE`.

# Adding questions

To use specially-styled questions like the ones below, place `<div>` tags around them like so: 

```
<div class="question">

1. Your first question here.

You can add text here too.

1. Your second question here.

</div>
```

<div class="question">
1. Your first question here.

You can add text here too.

1. Your second question here.
</div>

# Add a footer

If you want a custom footer, then add your footer text within the designated `<p>` `</p>` tags at the bottom of this lesson.

# Goodbye!
